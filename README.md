# Crystal Assault: Veiled Conquest
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2024

## Theme
We interpreted the "reverse" theme as the reversal of a core game mechanic. Most tower defense games have the player root their towers down, while mobile enemies are able to move through a path with the goal of destroying the player's towers. We applied our interpretation by creating a reverse tower defense, where the player is essentially the antagonist, spawning the evil units to defeat the towers.

## Game Play
The objective of the game is to explore the map, find the sacred crystal, and destroy it.

To play, you will:
- Spawn units using souls
- Strategize on where your units will be most effective
- Destroy towers blocking your progress
- Destroy the crystal

## Impediments
We encountered some setbacks, including variables not existing in certain contexts since one team member had created it in a different scene. Additionally, we realized that we would need a lot more grass tiles than initially planned for, because the way the map generated them created oddly mismatched tiles.
